# Brain Changelog

Every material change to the `brain/` folder gets a line here. Date in ISO, author initial or agent name, and a one-line summary.

## 2026-04-17 · brain audit + cleanup

- **README** rewritten — cleaner index table, expanded agent protocol with question-type routing, PDF source table.
- **`06-intake-form.md`** fully updated — accurate 9-section architecture tree, Supabase integration table, full state-object shape, roadmap v1→v4.
- **`07-proposal-site.md`** updated — notes `shared-header.js`, correct section count, footer logo treatment, theme event wiring.
- **`09-database.md`** new — Supabase project details, table schema, storage bucket, upload flow, future schema plan.
- **`00-project.md`** updated — deliverables table now includes `shared-header.js`, `utils/supabase/client.js`, migration file.
- **`products.json`** — removed fake `$schema` URL, added `_note` with dual-update reminder.
- **`brain-index.json`** — updated descriptions for `06-intake-form` and `07-proposal-site`; added `09-database` entry.

## 2026-04-17 · shared header, Supabase, intake.html

- **Renamed** `intake.html` (was `onboarding.html`). All internal links updated.
- **Shared header** (`shared-header.js`) created — both `index.html` and `intake.html` now render the same fixed header (logo-icon crop, nav, theme toggle). Footer logo in `index.html` updated to match.
- **Supabase connection** wired (`utils/supabase/client.js`, `.env.local`). Browser client exposes `window.SaundersDB`. Project URL: `https://usdenbguhahvzmufwvgo.supabase.co`.
- **Appliance Packets upload** section added to `intake.html`. Drag-and-drop PDF upload → Supabase Storage bucket `appliance-packets`. Each file stored under `{client-name}/{timestamp}-{filename}`. Public URL saved in `state.appliancePackets`.
- **Save to Database** button added to `intake.html`. Saves full form state to `intake_submissions` table (schema in `utils/supabase/client.js`). Returns record ID on success.
- **Component seed** expanded from 1 (Island) to 3 (Island, Lower Cabinets, Upper Cabinets) with explanatory hint text.
- Brain docs updated: `onboarding.html` → `intake.html` across all files.
